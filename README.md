# DBMS (Database Management System)

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. 
It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

DBMS can be classified into two types: 
1.Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
2.Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)

RDBMS:
     Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.
NoSQL: 
     Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.
